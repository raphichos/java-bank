# 💳 Java Bank – Financial Transaction Control App

A simple financial transaction control system built in Java.  
The project demonstrates modeling of accounts, investments, and transaction history with a focus on **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.

---

## Features
- Create bank accounts with **Pix keys**
- Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers
- Manage investment accounts linked to user wallets
- Maintain an **auditable transaction history** with timestamps
- Use repositories to separate persistence logic
- Store all values in **centavos** to avoid floating-point errors

---

## Tech & Tools
- **Java 21** (Gradle project)
- **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate (getters, equals/hashCode, toString)
- **Collections Framework** (`List`, `Map`, `Stream`)
- **Date/Time API** (`OffsetDateTime`, `ChronoUnit`)
